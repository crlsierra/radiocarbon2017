## Internet access
Visitors to the Institute have two options to access the internet:

* **Eduroam**: The Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry is a member of [eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/). If your home institution is also a member, you only need to use your login credentials (usually your own email and password) to access and easily connect to the internet.
* **BGC_guest**: To access this network you need to obtain a WPA-Key and a password. Please ask course organizers for this information.
