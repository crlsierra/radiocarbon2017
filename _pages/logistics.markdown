# Public transportation
The city of Jena has a very good public transportation system. Please consult the following link to plane your commute

The closest bus station to the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry is **Beutenberg Campus**. When you get off the bus,
walk in the direction oposite to the trafic lights. You will find Hans-Kn√∂ll-Strasse, go up the
hill, and at the very end of the street you will find the building with the round tower where the Institute is located. 
Here is a map of the campus:

## Internet access
Visitors to the Institute have two options to access the internet:

* **Eduroam**: The Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry is a member of [eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/). If your home institution is also a member, you only need to use your login credentials (usually your own email and password) to access and easily connect to the internet.
* **BGC_guest**: To access this network you need to obtain a WPA-Key and a password. Please ask course organizers for this information.
